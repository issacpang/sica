# Note: The following rubrics are only proposed suggestions. The final version should be confirmed by the Engineer.

id: hinges_joints
version: 1
scope:
  component: "Intermediate Deck Joints and Hinges"
  intent: "Post-earthquake expansion joint and hinge seat assessment"

r_states:
  R1:
    label: "Open"
    cues:
      - "Joint assembly appears intact and functional."
      - "Expansion joint gap is uniform with no debris blockage."
      - "No vertical offset (bump) between the two deck sections."
      - "Railing across the joint is continuous and aligned."

  R3:
    label: "Close but inspection needed"
    cues:
      - "Unusually wide hinge joint opening or visible separation indicating relative movement."
      - "Vertical drop or misalignment at the deck, railing, or barrier across the hinge joint."
      - "Loss or significant reduction of bearing area at the hinge seat (hinge seat failure)."
      - "Spalled, crushed, or broken concrete at or near the hinge seat."
      - "Joint seal no longer fills the joint."
      - "Remaining hinge seat length appears reduced."

decision_rules:
  - "Classify based on the inspection photo only; reference images are for calibration."
  - "If any R3 cue is clearly present, classify as R3."
  - "Unseating risk or reduced hinge seat length is treated as high-risk due to collapse potential during aftershocks."

output:
  requirement: "Return only JSON. Keys: component_id, r_state, reason."
  reason_guidance:
    - "Reason must specifically name the issue: e.g. 'Hinge seat failure', 'Unseated span', 'Minor joint spalling'."
